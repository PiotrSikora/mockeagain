Description
===========

This tool emulates an ideally slow network by mocking the
polling and read/write syscalls exposed by glibc via the
LD_PRELOAD technique.

Build
=====

Just issue the following command to build the file mockeagain.so

    make

The gcc compiler is required.

Usage

For now, only "poll" syscall and slow writing mocking are supported.

Here we take Nginx as an example:

1. Ensure that you have passed the --with-poll_module option while
   invoking nginx's configure script to build nginx.

2. Ensure that you've enabled the "poll" event model in your nginx.conf:

    events {
        use poll;
        worker_connections 1024;
    }

3. Ensure that you've disabled nginx's own write buffer:

    postpone_output 1; # only postpone a single byte, default 1460 bytes

4. Run your Nginx this way:

    LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/mockeagain.so /path/to/nginx ...

TODO

* add support for other event interfaces like epoll, select, kqueue, and more.
* add support for slow read mocking.
